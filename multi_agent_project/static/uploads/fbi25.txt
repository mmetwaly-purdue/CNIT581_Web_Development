Report Date 27 April, 2003. FBI [From police in North Bergen, NJ]: In the early morning hours of April 26, 2003 a passerby reported a fire in a carpet shop that is managed by a Erica Hahn of North Bergen . The fire seems to have been started the night before when someone tossed a cigarette butt into a waste basket in the basement of the shop. While firemen were extinguishing the blaze, they discovered several cartons labeled: PRIVATE: DO NOT OPEN. These cartons contained C-4 explosive. Attempts to reach Erica Hahn have not been successful. An employee at the carpet shop later told police that Erica Hahn had just gone on a vacation in Canada and that she had left no address.
