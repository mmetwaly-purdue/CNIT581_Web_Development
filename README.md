Design Iteration and Refinement
Feedback Review: Due to a misunderstanding of the Project 1 Evaluation, we did not receive direct feedback. However, we applied insights from our feedback on other groupsâ€™ work and adhered to design heuristics. While no specific changes were requested, we identified and corrected several design flaws as we progressed.

Design Refinement: The most significant changes from Project 1 to Project 2 were made to the Agent Workflow page. We aimed to improve how users interact with their data. In our initial design, the page lacked clarity on how users would input information to form connections. Originally, users had to input data manually, and document access required console interaction. In our second iteration, we shifted to a more user-friendly approach. We retained the storyboard-like connections between agents but added features that allow users to highlight and annotate documents directly from the workflow page. Now, when an agent is added to the workflow, it includes the agent's name, the document's file name, and the document itself. This streamlines the process, allowing users to easily annotate and interact with their documents without navigating to other sections.

Documentation:

Homepage: Minimal changes were made to the homepage as it already met our goals. We reduced the number of example workflows to avoid overwhelming users, settling on three relevant examples. Additionally, we simplified the footer, removing unnecessary placeholders and retaining only essential tabs: About Us, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service.

Agents Page: Significant revisions were made to the Agents page. We reduced the number of default agents, encouraging users to create new agents tailored to their needs. The hover content box was removed as it duplicated information found on the agent detail page. A "Delete Agent" button was added, allowing users to remove both default and custom agents. The "Filter" and "Create Group" buttons were omitted, as we determined that most users would not require these features given the expected number of agents in use.

Create Page: The Create page remained mostly unchanged from Project 1. We felt the current design strikes a balance between specificity and simplicity. The only notable change was the repositioning of the "Create New Agent" button.

Agent Detailed Page: The Agent Detailed page saw minor changes, mostly formatting-related. Functionally, it remains similar to the Project 1 version. One notable change is that agents are now automatically sent to the workflow page after document upload, streamlining the process for users. We maintained the simplicity of the design to ensure new users can easily navigate the platform and view their agents' details.

Agent Workflow Page: The Agent Workflow page underwent considerable revisions. Agents are now automatically sent to the workflow page, allowing us to eliminate the need for "Refresh" and "Add Agent" buttons. Agents are displayed side by side for a more organized layout, and documents are embedded within each agent so that users can view and annotate them without navigating away. In the original design, users had to manually call agents via the console, but now connections are displayed visually with color-coded highlights. Users can specify connections through the "Specify Connections to Explore" area and use various connection buttons. The "Summary" button allows users to view all connections, deletions, and highlights made in a session, with a filter feature to manage complex workflows. These changes improve the user's ability to interact with data while maintaining an organized and accessible workspace.


CHAT GPT CITATIONS

Generating our Ideas into a consisive thought.
About Us Page: We used [ChatGPT (https://openai.com/chatgpt)] to help draft the About Us page for our website. The tool was used to provide an initial draft of the page in 2 iterations. The output from this tool was modified by both of us incorporating our original ideas and rewording the content to make it sound more human and natural. All information was first generated by us and then reworded and sent back to us, and we made changes to it for better clarity and tone.

Takes our ideas and make sure that the legal language and format is correct.
Terms of Service: We used [ChatGPT (https://openai.com/chatgpt)] to help write the Terms of Service for our website. The tool was used to provide the structure and wording of the legal document over 3 drafts. The output from this tool was modified by both of us reviewing the legal language, ensuring it aligned with the policies of our website, and rewording it to improve readability and formality. All information was first generated by us and then reworded and sent back to us, and we made changes to ensure legal accuracy.

Helped by comparing our privacy policy with other privacy policies to make changes and make sure it is correct. 
Privacy Policy: We used [ChatGPT (https://openai.com/chatgpt)] to assist in writing the Privacy Policy for our website. The tool was used to generate an initial version of the policy in 2 drafts. The output was modified by both of us personalizing it to reflect the specific data handling practices of our website and rephrasing it to be more user-friendly. All information was first generated by us and then reworded and sent back to us, and we adjusted the content for greater transparency and legal compliance.

General Syntax Across All Pages: We used [ChatGPT (https://openai.com/chatgpt)] to assist with the syntax for all pages of our website, as well as helping with building different parts of the website and debugging errors. The tool was used in multiple iterations to ensure consistent language and structure across various sections of the site. The output was modified by both of us to resolve coding and content issues.
